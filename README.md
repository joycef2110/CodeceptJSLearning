#Introduction to CodeceptJS

CodeceptJS is a modern end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It is designed to make writing and executing tests simple and efficient by providing a high-level API that abstracts the complexities of browser interactions. CodeceptJS supports various testing backends, including WebDriver, Puppeteer, Playwright, and TestCafe, making it highly versatile and adaptable to different testing environments.

Key features of CodeceptJS include:

Easy to Write Tests: Using a simple, human-readable syntax, CodeceptJS allows testers to write tests that are easy to understand and maintain.
Flexible Configuration: CodeceptJS supports multiple testing engines and can be configured to suit various project requirements.
Powerful Assertions: Built-in assertion libraries enable comprehensive and accurate validation of web application behavior.
Interactive Debugging: The interactive pause feature lets you inspect the browser and run commands in real-time during test execution.
CodeceptJS is an excellent choice for developers and testers seeking an efficient, robust, and user-friendly tool for end-to-end testing of web applications.
